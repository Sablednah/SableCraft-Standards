/**
 * Which build this is — the commit these bytes came from.
 *
 * <h2>Why a version number is not enough</h2>
 *
 * <p>A version answers "which release". During development that is a different question from
 * "which bytes", and the gap between the two cost three sessions time in a single day: a jar
 * rebuilt under an unchanged version broke an already-shipped consumer, a dependency range admitted
 * a jar it could not run against, and nobody could tell a stale instance jar from its filename.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>The startup log line is the half that matters.</b> A stamp inside a jar says what is on
 * disk. The log line says what actually <em>ran</em> — which is the question a bug report needs
 * answered, and the one none of us could answer afterwards.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Three decisions worth keeping</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Read the properties file, not the manifest.</b> A dev run loads from a classes directory:
 *     there is no jar and therefore no manifest. The manifest carries the same four values for
 *     anything inspecting a jar without loading it, which is the shell-side question.</li>
 * <li><b>The resource is namespaced</b> under {@code /standards/}. A bare {@code /build.properties}
 *     collides with every other mod doing this on a shared classpath, and you would silently read
 *     somebody else's stamp — a diagnostic that lies is worse than none.</li>
 * <li><b>A missing stamp degrades to {@code unknown} and never throws.</b> This is diagnostic
 *     information, not a dependency, and it must never be the reason a mod fails to load.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Format agreed with LegendQuest, which built it first and proposed it. Deliberately copied
 * rather than shared: five copies of sixty lines is less coupling than another artifact every mod
 * depends on for a diagnostic, and this one above all must not be able to break a build.</p>
