# Normally run for you by .github/workflows/curseforge.yml when a GitHub release is published, so
# publishing to GitHub publishes to CurseForge too. Runnable by hand for a re-upload.
#
# ONLY JARS GO TO CURSEFORGE. A mod project accepts jar/litemod and nothing else. The upload API
# nonetheless accepts a .zip with HTTP 200 and moderation kills it afterwards, so a zip upload looks
# completely successful until you check the authors file list.
#
# The Minecraft version defaults to `minecraft_version` in gradle.properties, so a single-version
# mod needs no argument and cannot drift from what was actually built.
#
# CurseForge wants numeric game-version IDs rather than names, and those IDs change as new versions
# are added, so they are looked up from the API every run instead of being hardcoded.
#
# Uses python3 rather than jq: jq is not installed on the dev box and python3 is, so this stays
# runnable locally as well as on a CI runner.
#
# NOTE: the upload API can only add files to a project that already exists. Unlike Modrinth there is
# no create-project endpoint — make the project on the website first, then put its numeric ID in
# CURSEFORGE_PROJECT_ID.
